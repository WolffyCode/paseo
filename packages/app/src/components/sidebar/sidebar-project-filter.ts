 * The subset of a stored project filter that still names a project the sidebar can see.

 * Empty means "all projects" — both when nothing is pinned and when everything pinned has gone
 * away. That second case is why nothing ever deletes a stored key: the project list is narrowed
 * by the host filter and is empty before any host connects, so absence does not mean the project
 * is gone. A filter goes inert while its host is away and comes back with it.
 *
 * This is the only definition of "is a project filter active". The menu's indicator, the
 * "All projects" check and the per-row selection all read it, so they cannot disagree with what
 * the list is actually doing.
